## Getting this project up and running

1.  **Fork or Clone**

    Fork or clone this project from Github to get your own copy of it.

1.  **Add Contentful Credentials in environment files**

    This project is based on Contentful, add your own credentials in `.env.development` and `.env.production` files or remove Contentful dependency to use another data source instead.

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd portfolio/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `portfolio` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.tsx`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
